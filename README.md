### Libraries and packages used: csv, openpyxl

The program is split in between three major parts. We have the parser, the infection checker, and the data processor. The parser takes the school records that were provided and inputs them into dictionaries. The infection checker attempts at simulating the spread of ZBY1 among the school. We took into account all locations that students or teachers that are confirmed to have ZBY1 and determined a probability of whether a teacher or student has ZBY1 as well as who they have been infected by. Then come in our data processor where we made our correlations and exported the data into a readable format.
